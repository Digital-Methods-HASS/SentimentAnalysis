This document expands the IPCC sentiment analysis with a Danish implementation of Sentida package. It requires the same packages as IPCC plus the Danish-specific resources. In short, run W11 first, then this script. 

## Load the Sentida package

```{r}
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("Guscode/Sentida")

library(Sentida)
```

Now that we have the toolkit, locate a suitable Danish dataset. 
Let's see about the Stiften subset

```{r}

```
